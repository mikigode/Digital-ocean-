To deploy your application on DigitalOcean from GitHub, follow these general steps:

1. **Create a DigitalOcean account:**
   If you don't have an account, sign up on the DigitalOcean website.

2. **Create a Droplet:**
   - Log in to your DigitalOcean account.
   - Click on "Create" and then "Droplets."
   - Choose your desired operating system, plan, and any additional settings.
   - Under "Authentication," choose SSH keys for secure access.

3. **Set up SSH key:**
   - If you haven't set up SSH keys, follow DigitalOcean's guide to [add your SSH key](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/ssh/create-ssh-keys/).

4. **Clone your GitHub repository:**
   - SSH: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git`
   - HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`

5. **Configure your application:**
   - Modify any necessary configurations for your application, like database connections or environment variables.

6. **Install dependencies:**
   - Use package managers like npm or pip to install dependencies specified in your project.

7. **Build your application:**
   - If your project requires a build step, run the necessary build commands.

8. **Set up a web server (if needed):**
   - Configure the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve your application. DigitalOcean provides [tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/) for various server setups.

9. **Configure domain (if applicable):**
   - Update DNS settings if you have a domain pointing to your DigitalOcean Droplet.

10. **Deploy your code:**
   - Copy your application code to the Droplet.
   - Restart your web server or application server.

11. **Monitor logs:**
   - Check server logs for any errors or issues.

Remember that these are general steps, and the exact process may vary depending on your application's stack. Always refer to DigitalOcean's documentation and your application's documentation for specific instructions.
